Google Drive URL Uploader Using Colab

This DriveUploder code can help you upload direct URLs to your Google drive. 

First it'll be downloaded to Colab and then you need to transfer it it Google Drive, before the server is restarting.
If the server restarts, you'll loose your downloaded files. 

The other proplem it has is, it doesn't support multiple slots and it can't resume downloading if it's stopped at a point. 
So, you will have to restart the downloading in such cases.
